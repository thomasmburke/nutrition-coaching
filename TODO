TODO:
- Pull historical dataset for any user (Adhoc command)
- Rerun a specific day for any user (Adhoc command)
- Email alerts on job failures with error message
- Can I leverage structured logging? ultimately would like to get the funcName with the logging
    - https://googleapis.dev/python/logging/latest/stdlib-usage.html -> this might be all that is needed
- Add MACROS section to bottom of weekly view so Margaux knows where to write
- Macro history worksheet that captures any change in macros and logs it with the Date they were changed
- Weight History graph
    - 1 week
    - 1 month
