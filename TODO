- Put credentials in Secrets Manager or another credential holder instead of as env variables
- Create a list of clients in a dictionary that can be used to pull creds down
- Pull historical dataset for any user (Adhoc command)
- Rerun a specific day for any user (Adhoc command)
- Insert dataframe without headers in first row (this should replace a day if already present)
